# Webform Workflow

## Currently behavior:
- Creates a field type that allows an editor to reference a Webform ID and saves the referred Webform serialized config when saving field's entity.

## Ideas for improvements
- Autocomplete for form ID.
- Checkbox to specify if form should be "pushed" or not or some bulk way to "push" Webform config to all entities referencing it.
