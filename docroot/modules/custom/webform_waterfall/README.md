Current functionality:

- Select lender.
- Required fields for lender are added automatically. Required fields are hardcoded in the code.

Possible improvements:

- JS to submit data.
- Create permission "Allow required fields delete." and required functionality.
- Allow required fields configuration on a Lender entity or admin page.
